# Welcome to my boring theory

A good UI is not hard to explain, but a single paragraph cannot describe it. A good UI is a combination of consistency, familiarity, expressive, clean and meaningful animations.

## Consistency: 
> Each application should have a design language and it should be followed throughout the app. Example: font size/color (Title/Subtitle/Button), theme, even the words. Words (It cannot be "add friend" on one page and "connect friend" on another page). The user should not feel they are using a different app on every page.

## Familiarity: 
> The user should feel familiar with the app even if he is new to it. This can be achieved by adopting existing popular designs with which most of the users are much familiar. This is very important because if the user doesn't understand the flow in the first 15seconds, that user might not come back at all. Even the actions can be simple as icons which takes less space and more understandable. Example: A pen icon means to edit. 

## Expressive: 
> An app should be expressive enough to tell the user what is happening. It can be loading some post, downloading some file, or an error occurred. All should be expressed to the user in a humanly understandable way. For example, the app cannot show "Loading..." while downloading a file, and it would be better to show progress to tell the user how long it will take and how much is done.

##  Clean and Minimalist: 
> The app should not show so much information on a single page. Six pages with six information are always better than one page cluttered with six information. For example, if a user visits someone's profile, he should be able to chat and see posts and photos. He should not be bombarded with all possible actions and information like block/report, birthday and other information that is not important to a platform.

## Meaningful Animations: 
> This is my personal favorite. I see behind this simple theory that everything is connected and things cannot appear out of thin air. I follow this one even if it is not part of the designs. Not every action needs animation, but animations are good to keep the user focused on flow direction. Example: Clicking on an image in the gallery shows that the image is zooming into fullscreen. Touch feedback on buttons.

## My View:
> But a good UI is much more than those rules. Even with all those rules, things can trigger the OCD of the user. I had a similar experience with the Status app and tried to solve one of them by myself.  If you see the Status's first screen, the automated page switch is indicated by a page indicator. But the page indicator doesn't have continuity. When the page switches, the timer animation resets suddenly and changes to the next page. I tried my way to solve it. It is not the best solution, but better. 

    I created a page indicator with a much familiar UI in this demo by including the timeout indicator. The transition is smoother even when the user takes control of swiping the page.

## What makes the app engaging?
Now, this is a challenging topic with no straight answers.

## Data driven:
> Understanding user behavior plays a significant role in making the app more engaging. A feature should be introduced or continued based on analytics data from user behavior and not based on personal interests. But in some cases, the analytics data will mislead the product owners to keep a fancy useless feature
   * Example: Orkut gave lots of fancy features which many users used. The user traffic was good until Facebook was introduced and started pushing valuable and straightforward features to users like Facebook lite, offline post/chat, and personalization, which made the platform engaging and got an enormous user base.

## Error-free experience 
> This is one of the very important aspects of user engagement. That can also be achieved using data by reproducing steps and solving them quickly (Mixpanel is a great tool I have used to reproduce steps). 

## Incentive: 
> An incentive to users as a joining bonus to make the user feel he achieved something. The leaderboard is one way to do it because everyone wants to be seen and what other better way to achieve that than making your name come on top of the leaderboard.

## Personalized push:
> One of my favorite apps is Swiggy (Food delivery). When I leave some food on the cart, I get a notification with witty lines in a few minutes to remind me that the food is waiting for me. 

## Comparision:
> The most important thing is, stay ahead of the competition. Humans are curious creatures, and they want to explore. So if the user finds a competitor app that gives the same features, they will switch at least to try and lose that user.

## Conclusion
> Following these rules only gives a chance to survive. There are countless ways the app can be engaging. Most companies find different ways each day to engage users by analyzing the data, user behavior, trending topics and much more.
